 <h1>  At the Los Angeles Auto Show, an Industry Ponders Its Digital Future</h1>
    <br />
    <br />LOS ANGELES — For decades, the car business has been about style, performance, image and fuel efficiency. But suddenly, the industry is in a 
      <br />technological and sociological
    <br />upheaval that may force automobiles
    <br /> and the companies that make them
      <br />to change more in the next 
    <br />five years than they have in the last 50.
    <br />That was evident in this week’s AutoMobility
      <br />LA conference, an event held by the organizers of the Los Angeles Auto Show
    <br />which will continue over the next two weeks.
    <br />AutoMobility is an apt name
      <br />because much of the innovation seems to involve making the car ever more like a giant smartphone on wheels
    <br /> But social mobility is a factor
    <br />too, as carmakers confront the surging popularity of ride-hailing services,
      <br />which means fewer people see a need to own a car
    <br />while the push toward autonomous vehicles portends a time 
    <br /> when many cars will not need people to drive them.
