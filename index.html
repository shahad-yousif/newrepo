      <h1>How to Keep the Bloom on Rose</h1>

 there are many theories about the best method for keeping flowers fresh. I wanted to find out if one method reigned above all. So I asked some flower experts and tried my own (not very scientific) homegrown experiment.

To start, I bought nine stalks of chrysanthemums from a grocery store and put each stalk in a clean glass bottle with about 12 ounces of warm water and the following common treatments: <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
• Water alone <br>

• Water and putting flowers in a refrigerator every night <br>

• Sprite (¼ cup) and water<br>

• Vinegar (1 tbsp.), sugar (1 tbsp.) and water<br>

• Aspirin (1 crushed) and water<br>

• Penny, sugar (1 tsp.) and water<br>

• Bleach (2 drops), sugar (1 tsp.) and water<br>

• Flower food (½ packet) and water<br>
<br>

There’s some science behind these methods. But a word of caution before you try one: That little packet of flower food that came with the flowers may be your best bet. It likely has the right blend of antibacterial agents, a sugar source for food and an acidifier that will extend the life of your arrangement
